---------------
I. Introduction
---------------
This is a FTP Protocol Server module for Apache 2.0 and 2.1.
It is based loosly on the mod_pop3 code base, so many thanks to the author of 
mod_pop3. This is still a developmental module, and directives and features may
change without notice from release to release.  There is a sample configuration
provided at the end of this document.

----------------------------------------
II. Building and installing instructions
----------------------------------------
1) ./configure --with-apache=/path/to/apache
2) make
3) su -c "make install"

V. Known issues and limitations
--------------------------------
These are some of the known issues and limitations of the module.  Also check
the TODO file for any issues that didn't make their way into this document. And
of course, if you feel the urge to actually implement something on my TODO list
feel free to, and submit it to me via a patch.

* This module has been build using Apache 2.0.48. I have had people test it
on 2.0.47 and 2.1 CVS HEAD..  But I have not officially tested it on 2.1 yet.
When an official release of 2.1 is out, then I wil test and modify my module for
this branch of Apache.

* Transfered files do NOT go through apache filters and bucket brigades.. When
I figure them out, I will support that feature.. (dynamic FTP content..)

* IPv6 Support.. Yup, not in there.. It's in the TODO, I just need to support 
the extended FTP commands, and then hope it works, as I don't have an IPv6
network setup to test it on.

* I have not load tested this at all.. So I do not know how well it will stand
up to stress testing.

* The code has not been thoroughly tested for security related issues.. However,
the code is relatively simple, and all ACL checks go through one function, which
passes everything to Apache, is should be as secure as Apache.

* I do not support the ABOR command, currently, nor do I check for the Telnet
command sequences.. Can someone give me an example client that uses these?

You can contact me on irc.freenode.net as nick urkle in the #apache-modules
channel. Or you can Contact me via my website http://urkle.drip.ws/. Or e-mail 
me at eddie <at> omegaware <dot> com.  Please put a meaningful subject line, 
otherwise the e-mail may get spammed. Something like, "mod_ftp patch to 
implement ipv6" would be quite acceptable.. However, "PLEASE READ THIS NOW" is 
quite unacceptable and will most likely never be read.
